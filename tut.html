                <h2>What is C?</h2>
                <p>
                    C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.
                    It is a very popular language, despite being old. The main reason for its popularity is because it is a fundamental language in the field of computer science.
                    C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.
                    <h2>Why Learn C?</h2>
                    •	It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world.
                    •	If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, C#, etc, as the syntax is similar.
                    •	C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and Python
                    •	C is very versatile; it can be used in both applications and technologies.
                    <h2>Difference between C and C++</h2>
                    •	C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages have almost the same syntax
                    •	The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ support classes and objects, while C does not

                <h2>Get Started With C</h2>
                <p>
                    To start using C, you need two things:
                    •	A text editor, like Notepad, to write C code
                    •	A compiler, like GCC, to translate the C code into a language that the computer will understand
                    There are many text editors and compilers to choose from. In this tutorial, we will use an IDE (see below).
                    <h2>C Install IDE</h2>
                    An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is used to edit AND compile the code.
                    Popular IDE's include Code::Blocks, Eclipse, and Visual Studio. These are all free, and they can be used to both edit and debug C code.
                    Note: Web-based IDE's can work as well, but functionality is limited.
                    We will use Code::Blocks in our tutorial, which we believe is a good place to start.
                    You can find the latest version of Codeblocks at http://www.codeblocks.org/. Download the mingw-setup.exe file, which will install the text editor with a compiler.
                    <h2>C QuickStart</h2>
                    Let's create our first C file.
                    Open Codeblocks and go to File > New > Empty File.
                    Write the following C code and save the file as myfirstprogram.c (File > Save File as):
                     
                    Don't worry if you don't understand the code above - we will discuss it in detail in later chapters. For now, focus on how to run the code.
                    In Codeblocks, it should look like this:
                     
                    Then, go to Build > Build and Run to run (execute) the program. The result will look something to this:
                     
                    
                    <h2>Congratulations!</h2> You have now written and executed your first C program.

                <h2>C Syntax</h2>
                <p>

                    <h2>Syntax</h2>
                    You have already seen the following code a couple of times in the first chapters. Let's break it down to understand it better:
                     
                    <h2>Example explained</h2>
                    Line 1: #include <stdio.h> is a header file library that lets us work with input and output functions, such as printf() (used in line 4). Header files add functionality to C programs.
                    Line 2: A blank line. C ignores white space. But we use it to make the code more readable.
                    Line 3: Another thing that always appear in a C program is main(). This is called a function. Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed.
                    Line 4: printf() is a function used to output/print text to the screen. In our example, it will output "Hello World!".
                    Line 5: return 0 ends the main() function.
                    Line 6: Do not forget to add the closing curly bracket } to actually end the main function.
                    
                    <h2>Points To Remember</h2>
                    •	Every C statement ends with a semicolon ;
                    
                    •	            The body of int main() could also been written as:
                    int main(){printf("Hello World!");return 0;}
                    
                    
                    •	 The compiler ignores white spaces. However, multiple lines makes the code more readable.
                    <h2>C Statement
                    Statements</h2>
                    A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.
                    In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.
                    The following statement "instructs" the compiler to print the text "Hello World" to the screen:
                     
                    It is important that you end the statement with a semicolon ;
                    If you forget the semicolon (;), an error will occur and the program will not run:
                     
                    <h2>Many Statements</h2>
                    Most C programs contain many statements.
                    The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written:
                     
                    
                    <h2>Example explained</h2>
                    From the example above, we have three statements:
                    1.	printf("Hello World!");
                    2.	printf("Have a good day!");
                    3.	return 0;
                    The first statement is executed first (print "Hello World!" to the screen).
                    Then the second statement is executed (print "Have a good day!" to the screen).
                    And at last, the third statement is executed (end the C program successfully).
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    </p>
